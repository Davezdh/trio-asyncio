The non-underscore-prefixed names of trio-asyncio submodules (``trio_asyncio.loop``,
``trio_asyncio.adapter``, etc) have been deprecated; public names should be
imported from ``trio_asyncio`` directly.

``trio_asyncio.current_policy``, ``trio_asyncio.TrioChildWatcher``,
and ``trio_asyncio.TrioPolicy`` have been deprecated with no
replacement.  ``current_policy`` is no longer used at all, and the
other two are singletons that can't be customized so there's no reason
to make them publicly visible.

A number of functions which were already documented as deprecated now
raise the new :exc:`~trio_asyncio.TrioAsyncioDeprecationWarning` where
previously they provided either no runtime warning or a generic
:exc:`DeprecationWarning`.
